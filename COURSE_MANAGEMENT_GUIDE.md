# Course Enrollment Management System

## Overview
This system allows students to request enrollment in courses, and admins to approve or reject these requests through a comprehensive management interface.

## How It Works

### For Students:
1. **Browse Courses**: Navigate to any skill/course page via the main navigation
2. **Request Enrollment**: Click "Join Course" to submit an enrollment request
3. **Wait for Approval**: The system will show "Enrollment Request Pending" while waiting
4. **Start Learning**: Once approved, you can access all lessons in the course

### For Admins:
1. **Access Management**: Use the "Course Management" link in the profile dropdown (staff only)
2. **Review Requests**: See all pending enrollment requests with student information
3. **Make Decisions**: Approve or reject requests with optional notes
4. **Track Activity**: View recent approvals/rejections and system statistics

## System Features

### Student Experience:
- **Smart Status Display**: Shows current enrollment status (not requested, pending, or approved)
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant feedback when submitting requests
- **Resubmission**: Can resubmit if previously rejected
- **Course Protection**: Lessons are locked until enrollment is approved

### Admin Dashboard:
- **Comprehensive Overview**: Statistics cards showing pending, approved, rejected, and total enrolled
- **Batch Operations**: Approve/reject multiple requests at once
- **Detailed Information**: Student profiles, course details, and request timestamps
- **Admin Notes**: Add reasons for rejection to help students understand decisions
- **Activity History**: Track recent actions and admin who processed requests

### Database Structure:
- **CourseEnrollmentRequest**: Tracks all enrollment requests with status and timestamps
- **ApprovedCourseEnrollment**: Records successful enrollments for quick lookup
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who approved/rejected requests and when

## API Endpoints

### For Students:
- `POST /api/request-course-enrollment/` - Submit enrollment request
- `GET /api/check-course-enrollment/` - Check enrollment status

### For Admins:
- `GET /course-management/` - Admin dashboard
- `POST /course-management/process-enrollment/{id}/` - Approve/reject specific request

## Usage Examples

### Student Workflow:
1. Student clicks "Join Course" on Math > Practical Math > Money and Shopping
2. System creates CourseEnrollmentRequest with status='pending'
3. Student sees "Enrollment Request Pending" message
4. Admin approves request
5. System creates ApprovedCourseEnrollment record
6. Student can now access all lessons in the course

### Admin Workflow:
1. Admin visits `/course-management/`
2. Sees list of pending requests with student details
3. Clicks "Approve" or "Reject" with optional notes
4. System updates request status and creates enrollment if approved
5. Student immediately sees updated status on their course page

## Security Features
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require login
- **Staff Protection**: Admin functions restricted to staff users only
- **CSRF Protection**: All form submissions protected against CSRF attacks
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple requests for same course
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all admin actions

## Installation Steps Completed
1. âœ… Created new models: CourseEnrollmentRequest, ApprovedCourseEnrollment

4. âœ… Updated lessons.html with new enrollment flow
5. âœ… Created comprehensive admin template
6. âœ… Updated navigation with admin link
7. âœ… Configured Django admin interface
8. âœ… Applied database migrations

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Complete System

### Create Test Users:

1. **Create Admin User (if not exists)**:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

2. **Create Regular Student User**:
- Register normally through the website, OR
- Use Django admin to create user and uncheck "Staff status"

### Test the Full Workflow:

#### As Student:
1. Login as regular user
2. Navigate to any course (e.g., Math > Practical Math > Money and Shopping)  
3. Click "Join Course" - should show "Request Pending"
4. Lesson buttons should be disabled with "Request Pending"

#### As Admin:
1. Login as staff user
2. Click profile dropdown â†’ "Course Management"

âœ… **Smart Button States**: Lesson buttons reflect enrollment status
âœ… **Rejection Handling**: Clear messaging and resubmission option
âœ… **Admin Notes**: Rejection reasons visible to students
âœ… **Status Notifications**: Automatic alerts for status changes
âœ… **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Admin statistics and activity tracking

## Next Steps
- Test the system with student and admin accounts
- Customize admin notes for common rejection reasons
- Add email notifications for approval/rejection (optional)
- Consider adding course capacity limits (optional)
